## preliminary build notes, each item will be a line of bash code.
1) handle input, planned to be command line but could also be prompting.
2) download sc
3) cut command add embed logic... and autoplay
4) sed command insert into that one line.
5) test, do they have the environment to compile? if not lead them through the process.
6) compile with xcode tools.
7) 
8) make into an offbeat brew package?
